# CellCore

CellCore is a custom made cellular automaton designed to mimic [Sam Hogan](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCORkUj9eaM2aDJM1VYyDDTA)'s [Cell Machine](https://samhogan.itch.io/cell-machine).
CellCore features a variety of different cells, which can all interact, and is designed to make it easy to add more.
CellCore also features a level editor which lets you make and share .clc files.
Please note that unlike other Cell Machine inspired games, CellCore does not support level codes, only level files.
Contributions are accepted, and in fact, encouraged!
